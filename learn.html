                <p class="lead">The culture of Odisha highlights a multitude of temples and monuments showing proof of the exquisite architecture of the state. The earliest monuments date back to the third century  B.C. Odisha holds some of the finest architecture from ancient India from Jain Cut caves to Hindu temples to Buddhist stupas. The intrinsic artistic quality of the local craftsmen ensured that the monuments were embellished with religious influence, royal patronage, and a rich maritime trade in their sculptures and ornamentation. The larger body of temples called the Klina School group has a matrix of Indian Architecture that consists of four parts- the sanctum, the audience hall, the dancing hall, and the mandap where offerings are made.
